### CPSC 120

* Lab 6, part 1:
 This lab was fun because we used specific arguments (protein, bread, and condiment) to print a formatted message describing a sandwich with provided ingredients. I learned how to assign an argument to a string.

* Lab 7, part 2:
 This was my second favorite lab because it taught me how to validate command-line arguments for street name, day, hour, and minute. It was a challenge to write each if statement and assign them to bool functions.

* Lab 8, part 2:
 This was my favorite lab because I got to calculate the average of numbers provided as command-line arguments. I also learned how you can use for loops to iterate through each argument.
